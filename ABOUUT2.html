<h1>How to Food Travel</h1>

<p>There is a secret to unlock the full potential of this style of travel: Curiosity.

Try to understand not only what people eat, but why they eat in one way or another, what are the local ingredients, what is the story behind the food they prepare. Ask, interact and smile.
It makes a difference to go beyond the plate <br>

You will find that you will be learning much more about the local culture, directly from the locals, exchanging information, experimenting with new flavours, and having fun.
<br>
Something that always strikes us, for example, is to notice the similarities between the cuisine of distant countries or to think about how ingredients reached different parts of the globe and are used in different ways. For example, have you ever wondered how important the chilli pepper is for Asian cuisine even though it is a native ingredient to the Americas? With each trip, a new discovery!
A Food Travel is much more than travelling to eat <br>

We can learn a lot from a trip like this, meet people with different realities, lifestyle, and encourage the preservation of traditions. <br>

By sharing the table with local people, listening to their stories and talking about typical dishes, you will feel part of the place and will appreciate aspects that were previously unknown. <br>

On your next trip, try to understand and feel the destination by exploring the local cuisine and Iâ€™m sure you will never forget this experience.</p>

   <p><strong>currently am second year university student.the main aim of this website is to show my interest in photography and travelling.i have never been out of my country nor have i seen that much places inside my country aswell. but my main goal is to be able to travel and to capture good things in the process.</p> <br>
</strong> <p><strong>always used to wonder how traveling rejuvenated me. What is it about traveling that I love the most? Is it the beauty of the place? Or Is it the break from the daily monotony? Or does it have something to do with the thought process during the journey? Maybe it is about thoughts. The thoughts which let me delve deep down my memory lane and think of all the rights and wrongs, all the yeses and noes, and how different the life could have been, had I chosen a different path.</strong> </p>
