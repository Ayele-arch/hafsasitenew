    <h1>a little about photography
    </h1>
    <p>I like photography, specifically nature photography because it brings me just a little closer to what I love, the mountains, the wilderness, just being "out there". For the most part, pictures can't do justice to actually standing on a high peak or a flowing river, or just floating in a lake, however, they can remind you and perhaps touch upon the senses that is one's memory. Panoramics are cool and I've been toying with making more and more.</p>

    <p>I like photographny simply because the world is interesting. There's always something that's catching my eye, making me wish I had my camera with me. Simply put, life is beautiful. Photography is art. Some people have different tastes. Some like Nature, some like Urban. Some like seascapes, other landscapes. To me it really doesn't matter, as long as someone finds it interesting.
